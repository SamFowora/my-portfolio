# my-portfolio

## Description

This webpage is serving as my portfolio, and due to the fact that the starter code was very barebones, I found this quite the task. With the use of new CSS techniques, I feel a lot more confident about using HTML and CSS but I am still lacking quite a bit of knowledge in order to max out my potential with this code.
My motivation for this project was being able to make a page which would serve as a spot to find all my work - be it coding, architecture, or even other various things in the future.
The challenge this week was knowing what element/attribute to use whenever something was supposed to work in the live server but didn't work. Simila to last week, this trial and error was extremely intense, but I did gain things from it as I went along.


## Installation

## Usage

The website is simple to navigate (though missing essential elements such as alt text) and has everything neatly labelled. Due to the fact that this is a fundamentally unfinished product, there is still placeholder headings and content which will be replaced with actual projects as time goes by. The README will be updated to reflect that when it happens.
